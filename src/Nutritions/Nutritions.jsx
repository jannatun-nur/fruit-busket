            Grapes are a sweet, low-fat, and low-calorie treat. If you are
            trying to reduce your intake of processed foods or added sugars,
            grapes can be a good substitute for snacks like cookies and candy.
            Most of the health benefits of grapes come from the vitamins they
            contain. Grapes are a nearly fat-free food, providing far less than
            1 gram per serving.
